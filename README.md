# Personal Site Starter (Static, GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal one-page site you can deploy as `USERNAME.github.io`.

## How to use

1. **Rename placeholders** in `index.html` (Your Name, links) and the availability line.
2. **Add your CV** as `cv.pdf` at the repo root.
3. (Optional) Update publications/projects lists.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Create a new public repo named exactly `USERNAME.github.io`.
- Add these files, commit, and push to the `main` branch.
- Pages will serve automatically at `https://USERNAME.github.io` within a minute.

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step or dependencies.

## Later upgrades

- If you want a blog, migrate to **Hugo** or **Jekyll** and keep this look as the landing page.
- Add custom domain in repo settings when ready.
